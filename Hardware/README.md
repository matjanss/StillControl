# StillControl PCB v1.0
Simple Arduino Nano based solid state relay control hardware and software

---

The PCB is a relatively simple breakout board for an Arduino Nano, exposing a number of interfaces in JST PH (2.00mm) connectors and standard 2.54mm pin Headers:

- Footprint for an Arduino Nano V3 with (optional/additional) breakout pin row exposed.
- 3 potentiometers (with filter caps & resistor)
- 3 buffered and somewhat protected SSR outputs
- I2C for ie. display or other peripherals
- I2C header for a BMP388/390 barometer
- 1-Wire interface for temperature sensors
- Buzzer
- Error led connector
- On board 5V regulator, needs 9-12V
